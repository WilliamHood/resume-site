  <h1>William Anthony Hood</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  I entered the workforce right after high school and then decided to pursue my bachelorâ€™s degree a few years later. I maintained consistent employment while going to school full-
  time. Before I was able to seek employment in my BA field, I was blessed with my first child and decided to stay home to support my family. 
  Once my kids began going to school, I started a couple of ongoing part-time positions that offer flexibility to continue some of my stay-at-home dad responsibilities. 
  Now that they are older, I am ready to begin working full time again and would love to start my career with your company.
